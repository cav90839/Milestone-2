## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work 

###  A. Task Problem / Defintion

**Examine and describe your problem of study. Try to describe your problem using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. Why is it a problem? How is it theme-relevant? Use the Seven Stages of Action to describe a typical interaction related to your problem. How do you know this interaction is typical?**

PROBLEM:
The problem we will be focusing on is how even with the information we are able to receive from Athena many students still face many inconveniences with the location of classes upon the start of the semester. Despite being under the impression that students have successfully completed registration, some information in regards to class location is not even disclosed upfront often resulting in inflexible schedules and difficult commitments.

**Property**: Banner (ATHENA)

**Affordances**:
 Registering for classes
 Browsing Classes

**Signifiers**:

 Magnifier on notebook (catalog)
 Folder with paper
 Tabs with cursor

**Description**
- Setting (tools) icon
- Tools bar for other tasks in Banner (AKA Athena)

**Why is it a problem?**

This is a problem because students will have to sacrifice time in another class to make it to their next class (leaving early or arriving late). Moreover, students will not have a clear understanding of their schedules until after the semester starts.

**How is it theme relevant?**

It is theme relevant because class location plays a crucial role in a student's day by day schedule with in-person instruction. Being able to commute from one class to another is the bare minimum for being able to receive your course material in that class. However, if the student is unable to commute to another class due to the location of that class or the class they previously had before the upcoming class they must attend this force the student into a difficult situation especially if their only choice is through in-person instruction.

**Seven Stages of Action:** 

**Goals**
1.    _Goal (form the goal)_
Registering for classes within a schedule without conflicts.
Execution
2.    _Plan (the action)_
Go to Athena and look up each class or enter CRN?
3.    _Specify (the action sequence)_
Look up each class.
4.    _Perform (the action sequence)_
I will login, click browse classes, Select term registering for, Enter search criteria that has a subject, then search.
Evaluation
5.    _Perceive (the state of the world)_
We are able to see time available, but no location info (at first glance).
6.    _Interpret (the perception)_
I know my classes and that for time they do not overlap.
7.    _Compare (the outcome with the goal)_
Successfully registered for classes, but due to current location schedule conflicts occur.  

**How do you know this interaction is typical?**

Aldana Foigel, a student at Nova Southeastern University, stated in the Student-run Newspaper that her college had a 15 minute gap between classes. She argued that it was not enough time because she would always have a tight schedule and her peers would almost always arrive to classes late.

UGA students have trouble with buses during the first week of school. Reported by Red & Black several students have problems navigating getting to class in the allotted time even with buses. Some have even reported walking to class is  preferred, since you are not always guaranteed a spot on the bus. 

**DROP/ADD

**What user population is affected by your problem of study? What related tasks do they perform? How would users benefit from a solution (not necessarily your solution) to your problem of study?**

The user population that is affected by our problem would be students in college or higher education. These students are usually required to register for their classes; then, they are expected to attend class to learn the course material that they will be examined on. Students would benefit from a solution to college commutes because they would not have to sacrifice time from other classes just to get to their next class. They will also have a clear understanding of their class schedule, allowing them to have better management in time. 


###  B. Analysis of Existing Solutions

**What existing solutions, products, and services currently relate to your problem of study?**

- UGA adjusted in between class times to 20 instead of 15 min for students. Yet after a certain time they have an exception where they only get 15 min between.   https://reg.uga.edu/general-information/daily-class-schedule/
- Hybrid classes available 
- Oasis (UGA old system had warning if class was too far) 
 
 **Have others already attempted to solve your exact problem or something similar?** 

https://dbknews.com/0999/12/31/arc-c4il5rkf2fdkbdm3anxvp3j4ju/
While we have not found any other educational systems that attempt to solve this exact problem. We have seen that many students who are currently attending in-class instruction have tried to address the issue in their own way, by only selecting classes that have about 30 minutes in between class times. 

**What are the pros and cons of each existing solution, product, or service?**

**_PROS:_**
_UGA adjusting in between class times to 20 instead of 15 min for students:_
- Students have a bit more time to try and reach their designated classes.
_Hybrid Classes available:_
- This allows students to opt for a flexible option depending on their schedule and the timing of the class they can decide if it’s more optimal to appear in person or online depending on the day.

_Oasis (Uga old system):_
- Notified students letting them know if the class location was too far, and did not allow them to register for the class if it was. 

**_CONS:_**

_20 to 15:_
- Students may not be aware that a 20 minute break between classes reverts back to 15 minutes for classes beginning after 6 pm. 
- Longer schedules because of extended class time

_Hybrid Classes:_
- Face-to-face is less likely for students.
- Hybrid option may not be available
- Lack of personal connection between students and instructors

_Oasis (UGA old system)_
- OASIS requires students to visit several websites to access information, but ConnectUGA brings these services under one website.

**If a certain solution, product, or service is popular, then state that and justify why that’s the case – you might use published surveys or articles to help make your case.**

The change from 15 to 20 minute option was the most popular in the existing solutions. A lot of colleges used the approach of adding time in between classes as a solution.
 

**What guidelines or principles do these solutions, products, and services conform to, either officially or unofficially, if any? What guidelines or principles appropriately serve your users?**

Adjusting the time from 15 to 20 minutes would require updating agency policies because the class times for every class would have to change. Although this would change the times for every class, this solution still applies the principle of striving for consistency because each time is only added by 5 minutes and easy to adjust to. This change also helps keep users (students) in control of their schedules.  
The hybrid class system usually requires students to download Zoom to participate in class remotely. This could be practicing universal design because Zoom for higher education is used by 96% of top US universities. (https://www.datalinknetworks.net/dln_blog/microsoft-teams-vs.-zoom-vs-google-meet-for-education). Zoom is also free which follows the accessible technology guideline. This solution could follow the principle of striving for consistency because the remote classes are structured in a way that is very similar to face to face learning. 
Oasis would follow the guidelines of building awareness and support because the system would notify you if the commute from one class to another would be too long. It also follows the principle of offering informative feedback because users (students) will know if their schedule will be hard to maintain during the school year.
