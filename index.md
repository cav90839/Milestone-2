## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work 

###  A. Task Problem / Defintion

**Examine and describe your problem of study. Try to describe your problem using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. Why is it a problem? How is it theme-relevant? Use the Seven Stages of Action to describe a typical interaction related to your problem. How do you know this interaction is typical?**

**PROBLEM:**
The problem we will be focusing on is how even with the information we are able to receive from Athena many students still face many inconveniences with the location of classes upon the start of the semester. Despite being under the impression that students have successfully completed registration, some information in regards to class location is not even disclosed upfront often resulting in inflexible schedules and difficult commitments.

**Property**: Banner (ATHENA)
 Black, red, white, gray
 Icons, Buttons, Links

**Affordances**:
 Registering for classes
 Browsing Classes
 Preparing for Registration
 Browse Course Catalog
 View Registration Information

**Signifiers**:
 Calendar
 Clipboard
 Magnifier on paper
 Magnifier on notebook (catalog)
 Folder with paper
 Tabs with cursor
 Profile icon

**Description**
- Setting (tools) icon
- Tools bar for other tasks in Banner (AKA Athena)

**Why is it a problem?**

This is a problem because students will have to sacrifice time in another class to make it to their next class (leaving early or arriving late). Moreover, students will not have a clear understanding of their schedules until after the semester starts.

**How is it theme relevant?**

It is theme relevant because class location plays a crucial role in a student's day by day schedule with in-person instruction. Being able to commute from one class to another is the bare minimum for being able to receive your course material in that class. However, if the student is unable to commute to another class due to the location of that class or the class they previously had before the upcoming class they must attend this force the student into a difficult situation especially if their only choice is through in-person instruction.

**Seven Stages of Action:** 

**Goals**
1.    _Goal (form the goal)_
Registering for classes within a schedule without conflicts.
Execution
2.    _Plan (the action)_
Go to Athena and look up each class or enter CRN?
3.    _Specify (the action sequence)_
Look up each class.
4.    _Perform (the action sequence)_
I will login, click browse classes, Select term registering for, Enter search criteria that has a subject, then search.
Evaluation
5.    _Perceive (the state of the world)_
We are able to see time available, but no location info (at first glance).
6.    _Interpret (the perception)_
I know my classes and that for time they do not overlap.
7.    _Compare (the outcome with the goal)_
Successfully registered for classes, but due to current location schedule conflicts occur.  

**How do you know this interaction is typical?**

Aldana Foigel, a student at Nova Southeastern University, stated in the Student-run Newspaper that her college had a 15 minute gap between classes. She argued that it was not enough time because she would always have a tight schedule and her peers would almost always arrive to classes late. UGA students have trouble with buses during the first week of school. Reported by Red & Black several students have problems navigating getting to class in the allotted time even with buses. Some have even reported walking to class is  preferred, since you are not always guaranteed a spot on the bus. 

**DROP/ADD

**What user population is affected by your problem of study? What related tasks do they perform? How would users benefit from a solution (not necessarily your solution) to your problem of study?**

The user population that is affected by our problem would be students in college or higher education. These students are usually required to register for their classes; then, they are expected to attend class to learn the course material that they will be examined on. Students would benefit from a solution to college commutes because they would not have to sacrifice time from other classes just to get to their next class. They will also have a clear understanding of their class schedule, allowing them to have better management in time. 


###  B. Analysis of Existing Solutions

**What existing solutions, products, and services currently relate to your problem of study?**

- UGA adjusted in between class times to 20 instead of 15 min for students. Yet after a certain time they have an exception where they only get 15 min between.
- Hybrid classes available 
- Oasis (UGA old system had warning if class was too far) 
 
 **Have others already attempted to solve your exact problem or something similar?** 

While we have not found any other educational systems that attempt to solve this exact problem. We have seen that many students who are currently attending in-class instruction have tried to address the issue in their own way, by only selecting classes that have about 30 minutes in between class times. 

**What are the pros and cons of each existing solution, product, or service?**

**_PROS:_**

_UGA adjusting in between class times to 20 instead of 15 min for students:_
- Students have a bit more time to try and reach their designated classes.

_Hybrid Classes available:_
- This allows students to opt for a flexible option depending on their schedule and the timing of the class they can decide if it’s more optimal to appear in person or online depending on the day.


_Oasis (Uga old system):_
- Notified students letting them know if the class location was too far, and did not allow them to register for the class if it was. 

**_CONS:_**

_20 to 15:_
- Students may not be aware that a 20 minute break between classes reverts back to 15 minutes for classes beginning after 6 pm. 
- Longer schedules because of extended class time

_Hybrid Classes:_
- Face-to-face is less likely for students.
- Hybrid option may not be available
- Lack of personal connection between students and instructors


_Oasis (UGA old system)_
- OASIS requires students to visit several websites to access information, but ConnectUGA brings these services under one website.

**If a certain solution, product, or service is popular, then state that and justify why that’s the case – you might use published surveys or articles to help make your case.**

**Correction:**

(after more research for justification, we found that hybrid classes were actually a more popular option because of flexibility)

We believe that hybird classes would be the most popular solution. While hybird classes were implemented as a response to Covid-19, universities found other benefits in offering a hybrid option to students. Students who need extra time for assignments due to learning differences could access what they needed on their own time. Hybrid classes allow students to be more flexible because it allows them to work online at their own pace.

**What guidelines or principles do these solutions, products, and services conform to, either officially or unofficially, if any? What guidelines or principles appropriately serve your users?**

Adjusting the time from 15 to 20 minutes would require updating agency policies because the class times for every class would have to change. Although this would change the times for every class, this solution still applies the principle of striving for consistency because each time is only added by 5 minutes and easy to adjust to. This change also helps keep users (students) in control of their schedules.  

**Corrected:**

Guidelines for changing times in a schedule would be that all time changes must be requested prior to the opening of registration and time changes cannot be made once the term begins. This seems to be implemented to keep student schedules on a consistent schedule. Changing the times of each transition period will make days longer, which can hinder a students overall schedule if changed in the middle of a semester. Moreover, students must have access to planning tools and/or academic advisors to help them regularly update/maintain academic plans. We believe that keeping a consistent schedule and not being able to change times would appropriately serve our potential users. Changing the class times in the middle of a semester can become inconvenient to students who work part time jobs or commute to college.

The hybrid class system usually requires students to download Zoom to participate in class remotely. This could be practicing universal design because Zoom for higher education is used by 96% of top US universities. Zoom is also free which follows the accessible technology guideline. This solution could follow the principle of striving for consistency because the remote classes are structured in a way that is very similar to face to face learning. 

**Corrected:**
Guidelines for hybrid classes are that classroom attendance must be 50% or more of the course required hours. Classroom meetins must also be regularly scheduled on a daily or weekly basis for the duration of the class. Offering a hybrid class should have no affect on the Method of Instruction placed on a class. We believe that the guideline of having no affect on the Method of Instruction is very important. It would not be fair to students who choose to attend class in person if a hybrid class hinders the learning experience. We also believe that students should have a regular meeting scheduled for their hybrid classes. An inconsistent schedule could become a hinderance to a student because they would have to pay extra attention to when they would have classes.

Oasis would follow the guidelines of building awareness and support because the system would notify you if the commute from one class to another would be too long. It also follows the principle of offering informative feedback because users (students) will know if their schedule will be hard to maintain during the school year. 

**Corrected:**

In the Red and Black article, students have stated that Oasis was "outdated" and inefficient. Guidelines for web applications are the they must be easy and intuitive to use for students, they must function in a logical manner for the target audience, and they must use styles that are consistent throughout the appliation and within the associated website. Oasis would not follow this because students would have to open multiple websites to access information, while ConnectUGA would bring all the services in one website. Students also stated that Oasis felt "clunky and annoying" to use. We believe that making the web appliation easy and intuitive to use will be helpful for potential users. Many students in the Red and Black article stated that Oasis was outdated and were excited for ConnectUGA. Implementing a program like Oasis would need to follow those guidelines because even if it is helpful, if the service is not easy to use, many students may not want to use it.

###  C. Proposed Solution

**Using points from (A) and (B), propose a design solution to your problem of study. Do not propose a solution that’s in search of a problem! At this stage, let the problem lead you to a solution. Try to describe your solution using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. How does your proposed solution compare to existing solutions?**

We proposed having an option for the student to be able to view a map similar to Google maps that would provide the location of each class while also showcasing the day by day routing for each class depending on the day and times of the classes. This would give students a better idea of how their schedule may actually play out in real time. In terms of properties, this feature would be accessed via a tab similar to the schedule(button) and schedule details(button). We could have another tab that would have the text “Display Routing Map”. In the same gray front and formatting. It would afford displaying class location information, browsing a UGA architecture map, or the transportation/navigation map used on the UGA app for the bus routes. This feature would also afford opening as it would open up in a bigger box so that it can display the map for the student in a more ideal format. The tab button itself would be a signifier, the highlighting of the tab button in a blue tone would show the user that they have selected this feature. Different colored outlines that would signify the routing to each class from one another. There would also be certain properties that the map itself would provide which would be little icons representing buildings on the campus and a signifier would be the highlighting of the building that the class is being held in.

**How will you measure success?**

You do not need to supply an evaluation for this milestone; however, you should discuss what criteria should be used to judge if your design is a success or not.

We would send out a survey to current UGA students and use their response as a way to determine success. This survey will have questions like, “Was the ‘Display Routing Map’ feature useful?” or “Were you able to locate the “Display Routing Map” feature?” Receiving feedback will be the most useful way to determine if the “Display Routing Map” feature had any impact on registration.  These are better than the current existing solutions because students are able to know if they can reach their classes within the time limit without relying on a hybrid option in one page. 

**Correction:**
The survey will be on a 1-5 scale:

1- not very good

2- not good, but better

3- neutral

4- okay, but could be better

5- this is the greatest thing to ever be created!!

Students will answer questions about our solution and submit answers based on this scale.  If we find that answers to 'Was the Routing Map Useful' are mostly on 5's, we will deem that our solution was successful and vice-versa. If the question "Were you able to locate the "display Routing Map" feature was mostly 1, we would find a solution to make the accessibility of the feature more prominent.
